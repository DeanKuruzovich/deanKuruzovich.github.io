This website uses CSS to make custom buttons that look nice and fit with the style of the website. The site uses the architect theme to do something. Too be honest I don't know what it does but it there and doesn't crash the site so that about all I ask from it. The linked "photography" page links to a site with a bunch of cool photos from places I have been. The Portfolio button links to an outside web page of by portfolio that uses webflow.

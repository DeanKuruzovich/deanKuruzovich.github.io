            Throughout robotics club, I have been interested in robotic arms, which is why I began
            building one. My end goal has been to create a cheap, 3D-printable robotic arm using
            inexpensive motors rather than stepper motors or servos, which are typically used but
            are often significantly more expensive and have worse power ratings. This approach also
            allows me to design a custom control system.

            This was my first design of a robotic arm. It was experimental and had many flaws, but it
            allowed me to explore ideas like a custom 3D-printed planetary gearbox and mounting
            electronics on the arm to reduce wiring and avoid a large external driver board. The
            arm was driven by a Raspberry Pi 3 with the intention of using the camera module and
            AprilTags for control rather than external encoders.

            This is the gripper I designed. It is not powerful enough to do much as it uses a small
            9-gram servo.

            Before the second iteration, I built a mini arm using potentiometers to measure joint
            positions on a roughly 10 cm tall 3D-printed arm. The potentiometers are read by an
            Arduino Uno which can communicate with a larger arm driver for calibration potential training
            of future autonomous control systems.

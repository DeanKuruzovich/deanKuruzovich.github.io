    <h1>Wi-Fi Controlled RC Car</h1>

    <p>
        This project involved designing and building a Wi-Fi controlled RC car
        using a Raspberry Pi. The system streams live video from a Pi camera
        and allows remote control through a web interface.

    <p>
        The vehicle uses two servos for steering and throttle control.
        Communication is handled over a local Wi-Fi network, with a lightweight
        Python backend running on the Pi.

        This project focused on embedded systems, networking, and real-time
        control rather than frontend design.

        <h1>IOS Gamified Goal Tracker App</h1>



        <p>
            This project started as an experiment to make a simple iOS app using the Godot game engine.
            From this initial drive, I decided to build a simple gamified goal tracking app, as it would not only help me gain
            experience with the front-end elements of Godot, but also help me develop an understanding of what worked and what didn’t
            for iOS development in Godot. I planned to use this knowledge to help me develop future games with Godot for iOS.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had the goal of making a gamified goal tracking application where you could set and track
            goals with a game like experience, including a number of rewards and mechanics that utilized the Godot
            engine’s functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>Issues faced</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout the development process, I realized that Godot wasn’t the best choice for front end development,
            and that developing an app like this in Godot was neither easy nor efficient.
            It lacked many common libraries that are standard in other languages, such as Swift.
            For example, I had to code a library from scratch to calculate the time difference between two dates,
            including handling daylight savings time and leap years.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, the conversion from Godot to Xcode
            proved to be a major hassle due to a number of bugs and UI issues that appeared during the process.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection & Lessons Learned</h2>

        <p>Overall, this project taught me many lessons:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>The power of libraries.</li>
        <li>Front end development is much more difficult than I previously thought.</li>
        <li>The importance of resolutions, from individual textures to overall screen dimensions.</li>
        <li>Grand ideas with extensive feature lists and applications are often not the best approach; keeping things simple is usually better.</li>
        <li>What makes sense in a UI to you doesn’t always make sense to everyone else.</li>
        <li>A rainbow color scheme doesn’t work well for this type of project.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
       
        It also taught me how to plan, complete, and upload a full application, something I hadn’t really done before, since all of 
        my previous Godot projects were only prototypes. Most importantly, it taught me patience, as I spent hours debugging over many 
        days before finally finishing it. Although I wasn’t really happy with how it turned out and have since canceled my Apple Developer 
        subscription, meaning it is no longer on the App Store, it was an amazing feeling to have something I made published on such 
        a large scale and to see people all over the world download my app.

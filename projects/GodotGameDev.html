        Game Development
    </h2>
    <p>
    I have made a partually developed few games using the Godot Game Engine. I like Godot because it 
    is open source and has an active community of developers.

       I partially made an arcade style chess game intended for mobile. The goal of the game was to survive as it 
       continuously spawned different pieces and moved them in an attempt to checkmate you. You could also add 
       more pieces yourself by capturing the computer’s pieces, along with completing other tasks.
    </p>

        For this project, I had to write my own chess engine to handle the game’s unique nature of continuously spawning 
        pieces. This proved to be a challenge, as the engine I wrote was very slow taking over five seconds to make a move
         even with a small number of pieces on the board, despite running with a generous number of allocated threads on 
         a MacBook.

        I made a number of simulations of things I found interesting. I did this in Godot because I 
        am familiar with it and it is very easy to customize. While it is not very powerful, 
        it is powerful enough for moderately large simulations, though it uses more RAM than I would like.

        I was also developing a space themed, Terraria like game. Parts of the files were deleted, 
        but since I really enjoyed working on it, I hope to one day go back and piece it together 
        again from various backups.

        <h1>Raspberry Pi RC Car</h1>

        <p>
            I started this project because I already had many of the components on hand and thought
            it would be both fun and educational. It brought together several topics I am interested
            in, including battery power management, Raspberry Pi development, electrical motors,
            and computer networking.
        </p>

        <h2>Design & Hardware</h2>

        <p>
            The car is built around a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, which controls four small DC motors
            through an L298N motor driver. I chose the L298N primarily because I already had it,
            but it also worked well for this project since it can function as a buck converter.
            This allowed me to power both the motors and the Raspberry Pi from the same battery
            across a range of input voltages.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h2>Camera & Control</h2>

        <p>
            I attached a Raspberry Pi Camera module to a servo motor, allowing the camera to tilt
            up and down. The camera connects to the Pi Zero 2 W through the CSI port using a ribbon
            cable that is much longer than necessary, something I plan to fix in the future.
            Mounting the camera on a servo added an extra level of control and made exploring
            the environment more engaging.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most interesting parts of this project was the networking and software side.
            Using Flask, Picamera2, and OpenCV, I built a simple web application that streams the
            camera feed and allows the car to be driven remotely. Because the Pi Zero 2 W has
            built in WiFi, I could connect to the car from anywhere and drive it around my house
            with fairly low latency.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>

        <p>
            Overall, this project was extremely enjoyable and rewarding. It combined many of my
            interests Raspberry Pi development, web programming, battery powered systems, and
            electric motors into a single, functional project. Seeing all of these components
            work together in a finished system was especially satisfying.

      <h1>Hi, I’m Dean Kuruzovich</h1>

      <p class="lead">
        I’m a freshman at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute studying Electrical Engineering with a minor in Physics.
        I enjoy building things that live at the intersection of hardware and software.
      </p>

      <p>
       My main interests include embedded systems, robotics, and 3D printing. 
       I have experience working with platforms such as Raspberry Pi, ESP32, and Arduino, 
       and I enjoy projects that involve real world problem solving and that 
       are unique, challenging, and push me outside my comfort zone.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m currently seeking internships and technical roles where I can learn quickly,
        contribute meaningfully, and work hands on with engineering systems.
      </p>
